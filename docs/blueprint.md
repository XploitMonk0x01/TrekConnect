## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(50, 80%, 50%) converted to bright gold (#E6B800), conveying adventure, discovery, and a bit of luxury without being ostentatious.
- Background color: Desaturated, lighter tint of the primary color (#F8F5E7). It's a warm, neutral tone that lets the bright imagery take center stage.
- Accent color: A harmonious analogous color shifted ~30 degrees, a bright saturated orange, specifically  (#FF8000).
- Font pairing: 'Playfair' (serif) for headlines to bring an elegant feel and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text for readability and a modern, neutral tone.
- Outline style icons; use icons consistently.
- Card-based layout with rounded corners for a friendly feel. Utilize white space to prevent a cluttered interface.
- Smooth transitions and subtle animations on UI elements during profile discovery.
