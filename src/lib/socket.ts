// This file is largely deprecated for server initialization as that logic has moved to src/app/api/socket/route.ts
// It can be kept for shared types or client-side helper functions if needed in the future,
// or removed if no longer used.

// Example of what might remain or be added here (e.g., client-side helper types if any)
// export interface ClientSocketEventHandlers {
//   onConnect?: () => void;
//   onDisconnect?: (reason: string) => void;
//   onConnectError?: (error: Error) => void;
//   onReceiveMessage?: (message: Message) => void;
//   // ... other client-side event handlers
// }

// No server-side initSocket function here anymore.
// The Socket.IO server instance is now managed and attached directly within the
// API route handler at /src/app/api/socket/route.ts
// This is to better align with Next.js App Router patterns where direct HTTP server
// access from a generic library function is less straightforward.

console.log("[Socket Lib] src/lib/socket.ts is now minimal. Server initialization is in /api/socket/route.ts");
